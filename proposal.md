**Problem:**

Smaller Construction management teams have less resources and time to keep up with their busy days. Other than managing the team and projects they need to focus on the financial timelines and discussing projects with Stakeholders. Today&#39;s Project Management tools are designed for the Software Development teams that are usually inside offices, home office and coffee shops making it easier for them to access daily and update. Team Green is taking that idea but making it easier for the construction site, in truck and on the road lifestyle.

**Solution:**

Team Green app will make user experience with project management tool friendlier and allows them give up-to-dates information to their customers, clients, bosses.

Our app will allow for the leads to see progress in the financial and day to day workload. We are limiting the back and forth of chasing employees around for timesheets and daily progress.

With our teams experience we plan to bring the best, newest product to the table. The tools we will be using to create the app will include the following, Python, Data Visualization, Webscraping, HTML, Mongo DB and CSS.

Our deliverables will be an app that can be accessed through computers, touch pads and cell phones. The dashboard will be limited to your requirements and needs. We want our customers to have access to what they need.

We will measure our success based on user logins and daily updates. We want the end user to get a notification and feel the trust they want to have with their crew members, with a quick thank you for the update.
